The Webcam Video Recorder is a Python script using the OpenCV library to capture a video stream from your computer's webcam and save it as an AVI file. The script creates a VideoWriter object to encode and write the frames to the specified output file. The recording continues until the user presses the 'q' key to exit the program.
